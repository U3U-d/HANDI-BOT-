### 🎯 What Is Handi-Bot?

**Handi-Bot** is a hand-tracked robotic arm that mirrors human gestures using just a webcam, an Arduino Nano, and 6 servo motors. Built for affordability and modularity, it’s designed to teach **young learners** and **STEM educators** about:

- Computer vision using OpenCV + MediaPipe 🧠
- Signal processing + servo control with Arduino ⚙️
- Real-time motion tracking 🔄
- Robotics and engineering basics 🤓

---

### 💡 Key Features

✅ **Fully functional** robotic hand — tracks live hand motion  
✅ **MediaPipe + OpenCV** hand landmark detection  
✅ **Arduino Nano** & servo control via serial input  
✅ **Modular sensor support** (e.g., EMG, EEG, flex sensors)  
✅ **DIY-friendly design** under $100  
✅ Ideal for **schools, workshops, and self-learners**

### 🧠 How It Works

1. **MediaPipe** detects your hand landmarks from a webcam
2. A **Python script** reads landmark positions + maps them to angles
3. Angles are sent over **serial** to an Arduino Nano
4. The **Arduino** moves 6 servo motors to mirror the movement

### 🧒 About the Creator

Hi! I'm **Umayer Ahmmed**, a Grade 8 student passionate about robotics and engineering. I built Handi-Bot to help others learn about AI, motion control, and hardware — even if they’re just getting started.

This project is part of my science fair and personal exploration into making robotics **affordable**, **modular**, and **accessible** to everyone.
